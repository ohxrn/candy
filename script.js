//How do we know we need a loop here?
//It will recurrently scan numbers numerically until it's called to stop(mile six)
//What's the starting point of the loop?
//starting point will be (i=0)
//When should the loop stop?
//it will stop at 6.
//How will the loop know when to stop?
//when it hits 6.
//What's incrementing for each iteration of the loop?
//++ miles
//What variables do we need?
//var miles

//cmd d to highlight all x variables
